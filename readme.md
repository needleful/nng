# needleful net generator
This is a rewrite of my [old site generator, npsg](https://github.com/needleful/npsg).
I use C# for work, so I didn't want to use it everywhere. Plus, the code was getting quite verbose.
Prolog has some fancy symbolic manipulation that's theoretically well-suited for the task.
